- NOTE:
I did not have access to gitlab before class on 2/1. Montella gave me access during classtime. That is why this assignment is late.

- Briefly list all the programming languages you know (1 per line in a list)
Java
Javascript
C/C++
R(Rstudio)
HTML/CSS
Flutter
Matlab
Does arduino count?
Verilog (but I despise it and never want to code in it ever again)

- Describe the most complicated program you've written (or the one you're most proud of). What language was it written in?
For CSE303, we had to code a bunch of different aspects of a client server process such as concurrency, persistence, security, virtualization.
This was written in C/C++ and I worked with one other person. It was a semester long project and was very difficult. 

- Tell me what you'd like to get out of this class. Whether it be profieciency picking up new langauges, exposure to new programming paradigms, experience with particular tools or techniques, or anything else you'd like to tell me. 
I would like to have more programming languages under my belt. I would also like to be more proficient in my usage of VSC, Git, wsl, etc.
